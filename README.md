2. **Start typing** - Once the quote appears on the screen, start typing it as accurately and quickly as possible.

3. **Watch your progress** - As you type, the application will keep track of your WPM and accuracy percentage, which will be displayed on the screen once you complete each quote.

4. **Fix your mistakes** - If you make a mistake, the application will highlight it in red. You can go back and fix the mistake by using the backspace key.

5. **Complete the quote** - Keep typing until you've completed the entire quote. Once you've finished typing, the application will display your final WPM and accuracy percentage.

6. **Try again** - If you're not satisfied with your performance, you can simply hit "OK" on the window that displays your results, and it will automatically generate the next quote.
